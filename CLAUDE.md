# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal GitHub profile README repository for Santiago Trigo Porres. It is displayed on the GitHub profile page at github.com/trigoporres.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - The main profile page content with personal introduction, skills showcase, and GitHub statistics
- `assets/` - Image assets used in the README:
  - `cabecera1.png` - Header image (1500x500)
  - `image*.png` - Skill and technology icons (48x48)

## Content Guidelines

When editing the README:
- Maintain the existing header structure with animated greeting gif
- Keep skill icons in the `<p align="left">` section with proper spacing
- Preserve the GitHub stats badges and their styling (title_color: 0891b2, bg_color: 1c1917)
- Maintain links to external profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn)

## Common Tasks

Since this is a profile repository with no build process:
- **Preview changes**: View the rendered markdown in any markdown viewer or push to GitHub to see live changes
- **Check links**: Ensure all image paths and external URLs are valid
- **Validate HTML**: If adding new badges or icons, ensure proper HTML/markdown syntax
